# mayaCharts, open backlog

Single tracker for open work the CEO can pick up. One bullet per item: what, where, why, owner. Delete resolved items (git history keeps them). Every entry is a snapshot of when it was written: verify before acting.

## Needs a decision from the human

- **`frame: "<field>"` playback** (2026-10-06 showcase): folds the 21 to 23 line host loop of each motion tile into one spec line. About +200 B index, +500 B element and global. Needs a budget decision and the SSR frame choice (audit suggests the last frame). Owner: human, then core and element engineers.
- **New types in an opt-in `mayacharts/stat` module**: donut, funnel, then box plot and histogram (about 400 to 600 B each, own budget). 100% stack (`stack: "percent"`, about 100 B core) and per-field `aggregate` / `cumulative: true` (50 to 70 B) also wait on budget. Owner: human.
- **Bar race label placement**: values centred in one-colour bars read as a default; a Flourish-style race needs value-at-tip labels. Owner: human, then chart designer.

- **Unnamed scatter keys are row indexes**, so prepending data moves a selection to another dot. Changing it is a key contract change. Owner: human, then core engineer.

- **Zero rows reject treemap, sunburst, sankey and chord** (`non-positive-value`). One 0 in a BI extract fails the whole chart; skipping zeros like nulls changes the error contract. Owner: human, then core engineer.

## Open

- **Calendar at 360 px**: cells shrink to about 3 px (hexmap now prints values only when they are readable, 2026-10-07). Owner: chart designer.
- **Memory delta labels**: with `was`, a signed delta at the bar tip ("value (+12%)") so the change reads without hovering (design critic M1). Measured +40 B core; needs budget. Owner: human, then chart designer.
- **Orbit update motion** (motion critic M1, 2026-10-07): trails and labels jump at t=0 while planets glide, planets cut through the sun, and a speed-bucket change restarts the rotation. Fix in animate.ts (translate the label group with its planet) and theme (rescale currentTime by period ratio). Owner: element engineer, chart designer.
- **Brush zoom does not read as a zoom** (motion critic M2): #zoom is only set for a drill, so leaving points shrink in place and the old and new lines crossfade at different scales. Pass a box zoom for a window change. Owner: element engineer.
- **2D brush selects axis text** in Chromium (motion critic M4): `.maya-svg{user-select:none}` in theme.ts (theme has 7 B headroom). Owner: chart designer.
- **Table value cells jump on re-sort** (text marks have no geo()). Owner: element engineer.
- **Live region reads raw tabs and newlines** from multi-line data-f (tooltip.ts). Owner: element engineer.
- **Exiting sunburst rings still read getComputedStyle in the write loop** (animate.ts exit path). Owner: element engineer.
- **Units swarm**: colour carries nothing and one outlier squeezes the dots; a labelled median rule (units at 98.8% of budget). Owner: chart designer.
- **Stats and hierarchy keep local width estimates**: switching to `tw()` cost bytes in those two bundles (code-point spread), so they still use `length * 7.2`. Revisit if either budget moves. Owner: chart designer.
- **Heatmap and hexmap ink cut is tuned to the default accent**: a host accent with a different lightness can fail 4.5:1 on a step. Owner: chart designer.
- **Builder HTML snippet uses an inline style attribute** (security L), which fails under style-src without unsafe-inline. Owner: chart designer.
- **tokens.mjs and the README token block** are personal tooling in the repo (ponytail audit). Owner: human.

- **First full compare run after the dependency move** (`compare/package.json`): only `compare:bundle` and `compare:size` were run. Watch the next `compare.yml` run. Owner: core engineer.
- **Waffle share change**: cells keyed by name slide through each other (about 8% overlap mid-flight); key by grid position and let the fill transition carry the change. Owner: chart designer.
- **Treemap rank swaps**: tiles that change order cross mid-flight (15 to 36% overlap). Keep order stable or record a ceiling. Owner: chart designer.
